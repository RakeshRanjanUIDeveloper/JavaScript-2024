    <p>Arrow functions, on the other hand, do not have their own this context. 
        Instead, they capture this from the surrounding lexical context where they are defined. 
        This is determined at the time the arrow function is defined, not when it is called.</p>
    <p>If you need to use arguments in a function, you might run into an issue with arrow functions 
        since they don't have their own arguments object. In the arrow function,
         we use the rest parameter (...args) to achieve similar functionality to the arguments object.</p>
