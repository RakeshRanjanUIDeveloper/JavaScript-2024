        //objects are used to store keyed collections of various data
        //An object can be created with figure brackets {…} 

        // An empty object (“empty cabinet”) can be created using one of two syntaxes:

        let user1 = new Object(); //object constructor syntax
        let user2 = {}; //object literal syntax

        let user3 ={
            name:"Rakesh",
            age:32,
            'my address' :"Bangalore"
        }
        console.log(user3.name + " " + user3.age +" "+user3['my address']);

        //The value can be of any type. eg: boolean

        //We can also use multiword property names, but then they must be quoted:
        //They can be access like : object['property name']

        //Objects can also have methods (functions as properties):
        //Inside a method, this refers to the object itself:
        //Objects can contain other objects:
        let person ={
            fname:'ABC',
            lname:'XYZ',
            fullName:function(){
                console.log(this.fname +" "+this.lname);
            },
            location:{
                city:"Bangalore",
                state:"Karnataka"
            }
        }
        person.fullName();
        console.log(person.location.city);

        //JavaScript objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects via prototypes:

        function Animal(name){
            this.name = name;
        }
        Animal.prototype.speak = function(){
            console.log(this.name +" Makes a noise");
        }
        let dog = new Animal('Dog');
        dog.speak();

        //We can create a new object with a specified prototype object:

        let animal ={
            speak:function(){
                console.log('Animal speaks!!');
            }
        }
        let cat = Object.create(animal);
        cat.speak();

        //class-based approach to creating objects:
        class Person{
            constructor(name,age){
                this.name =name;
                this.age=age;
            }
            greet(){
                console.log('Hello ' + this.name);
            }
        }
        let p = new Person("Rakesh", 32);
        p.greet();
