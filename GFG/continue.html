    <h3>continue statement in Javascript is used to break the iteration of the loop and follow with the next iteration</h3>
    <h3>The major difference between the continue and break statement is that : <br>
        - break statement breaks out of the loop completely  <br>
        - continue is used to break one statement and iterate to the next statement. </h3>

                if( i%2 === 0) {
                    console.log(i);
                    continue;
                }
