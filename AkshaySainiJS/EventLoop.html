        After Printing start and End in the console. 
        <br>
        As we already know that timer of 5000ms was running and callback function was registered
        <br>
        callback function needs to go inside the call stack but it cant go directly
        <br>
        This callback function will go through callback queue 
        <br>
        so when timer expires this callback function moves inside the callback queue
        <br>
        And the event loop - the job of event loop is to check the callback queue and put this callback function into the call stack
        <br>
        So event loop acts like gate keeper and check if something we have in callback queue and if somthing and then it push inside the call stack.
